# UnitsOfMeasure
Creating a new version of a UoM project from a Software Engineering project

This solution might seem like a big mess, but I'm only using for testing and documentation, till I'm finished with making the database more normalized.
It's the QuantityType_1-12 and SameUnit_1-3__uom/namingSystem columns from the UnitsOfMeasure database, that I want to split into new tables.
When I'm done with the work, then I can get rid of these project and just reverse engineer the database into a new Entity Framework project.
